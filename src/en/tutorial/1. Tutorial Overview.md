## Overview

SQLAlchemy is a library in Python that facilitates the connection to databases and the use of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).  
For instance, you can execute specific queries in your code and perform a series of operations in the database through ORM objects.

## Offerings

SQLAlchemy is offered in the following two ways:

- **Core** 
    - This is the database toolkit and the foundational architecture of SQLAlchemy. 
    - It manages connections to databases, interacts with database queries and results, and provides tools to programmatically compose SQL statements.
- **ORM**
    - Built on top of Core, it provides optional **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping) features.

It is generally recommended to understand Core first before using ORM.  
This tutorial will start by explaining Core.
