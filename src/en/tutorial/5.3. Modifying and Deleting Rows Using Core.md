# Modifying and Deleting Rows Using Core

In this chapter, we explain the Update and Delete statements used for modifying and deleting existing rows using the Core approach in SQLAlchemy.

## Constructing SQL Expressions with `update()`

You can write an UPDATE statement as follows.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import update
>>> stmt = (
...     update(user_table).where(user_table.c.name == 'patrick').
...     values(fullname='Patrick the Star')
... )
>>> print(stmt)
'UPDATE user_account SET fullname=:fullname WHERE user_account.name = :name_1'
```

```python
>>> stmt = (
...     update(user_table).
...     values(fullname="Username: " + user_table.c.name)
... )
>>> print(stmt)
'UPDATE user_account SET fullname=(:name_1 || user_account.name)'
```

> The original text discusses `bindparam()`, but since I haven't seen many use cases for it, it is omitted in this text. If you're curious, please refer to [the original content](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/tutorial/data_update.html).

<br>

### Correlated Update

Using a [Correlated Subquery](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/tutorial/data_select.html#tutorial-scalar-subquery), you can utilize rows from another table as follows.

```python
>>> scalar_subq = (
...   select(address_table.c.email_address).
...   where(address_table.c.user_id == user_table.c.id).
...   order_by(address_table.c.id).
...   limit(1).
...   scalar_subquery()
... )
>>> update_stmt = update(user_table).values(fullname=scalar_subq)
>>> print(update_stmt)
"""
UPDATE user_account SET fullname=(SELECT address.email_address
FROM address
WHERE address.user_id = user_account.id ORDER BY address.id
LIMIT :param_1)
"""
```

<br>

### Updating with Conditions Related to Another Table

When updating a table, there are times when you need to set conditions in relation to information from another table.
In such cases, you can use it as shown in the example below.

```python
>>> update_stmt = (
...    update(user_table).
...    where(user_table.c.id == address_table.c.user_id).
...    where(address_table.c.email_address == 'patrick@aol.com').
...    values(fullname='Pat')
...  )
>>> print(update_stmt)
"""
UPDATE user_account SET fullname=:fullname FROM address
WHERE user_account.id = address.user_id AND address.email_address = :email_address_1
"""
```

<br>

### Updating Multiple Tables Simultaneously

You can simultaneously update specific values in multiple tables that meet certain conditions, as shown in the following example.

```python
>>> update_stmt = (
...    update(user_table).
...    where(user_table.c.id == address_table.c.user_id).
...    where(address_table.c.email_address == 'patrick@aol.com').
...    values(
...        {
...            user_table.c.fullname: "Pat",
...            address_table.c.email_address: "pat@aol.com"
...        }
...    )
...  )
>>> from sqlalchemy.dialects import mysql
>>> print(update_stmt.compile(dialect=mysql.dialect()))
"""
UPDATE user_account, address
SET address.email_address=%s, user_account.fullname=%s
WHERE user_account.id = address.user_id AND address.email_address = %s
"""
```

> I did not include a summary of the '[Parameter Ordered Updates](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/tutorial/data_update.html#parameter-ordered-updates)' section from the original text because I did not understand it.
> If someone understands this part well, it would be appreciated if you could contribute to this document.

<br>

## Constructing SQL Expressions with `delete()`

You can write a DELETE statement as follows.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import delete
>>> stmt = delete(user_table).where(user_table.c.name == 'patrick')
>>> print(stmt)
"""
DELETE FROM user_account WHERE user_account.name = :name_1
"""
```

<br>

### Deleting with a JOIN to Another Table

There are cases where you need to delete data that meets specific conditions after joining with another table. (If this is unclear, refer to [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11366006/mysql-join-on-vs-using) for clarification.)
In such cases, you can use it as shown in the example below.

```python
>>> delete_stmt = (
...    delete(user_table).
...    where(user_table.c.id == address_table.c.user_id).
...    where(address_table.c.email_address == 'patrick@aol.com')
...  )
>>> from sqlalchemy.dialects import mysql
>>> print(delete_stmt.compile(dialect=mysql.dialect()))
"""
DELETE FROM user_account USING user_account, address
WHERE user_account.id = address.user_id AND address.email_address = %s
"""
```

<br>

## Getting the Number of Rows Affected in UPDATE, DELETE

You can obtain the number of rows processed by a query using the ['Result.rowcount'](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.CursorResult.rowcount) property, as shown next.

```python
>>> with engine.begin() as conn:
...     result = conn.execute(
...         update(user_table).
...         values(fullname="Patrick McStar").
...         where(user_table.c.name == 'patrick')
...     )
...     print(result.rowcount)  # You can use the rowcount property of the Result object.

1  # The number of rows processed by the query (the same as the number of rows matching the conditions).
```

## Using RETURNING with UPDATE, DELETE

You can use the RETURNING syntax as follows.

For more on the RETURNING syntax, please see [this article](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/dml-returning.html).

```python
>>> update_stmt = (
...     update(user_table).where(user_table.c.name == 'patrick').
...     values(fullname='Patrick the Star').
...     returning(user_table.c.id, user_table.c.name)
... )
>>> print(update_stmt)
"""
UPDATE user_account SET fullname=:fullname
WHERE user_account.name = :name_1
RETURNING user_account.id, user_account.name
"""
```

```python
>>> delete_stmt = (
...     delete(user_table).where(user_table.c.name == 'patrick').
...     returning(user_table.c.id, user_table.c.name)
... )
>>> print(delete_stmt)
"""
DELETE FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.name = :name_1
RETURNING user_account.id, user_account.name
"""
```
