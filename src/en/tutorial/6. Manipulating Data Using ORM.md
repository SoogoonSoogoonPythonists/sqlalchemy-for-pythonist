# Manipulating Data Using ORM

Until the previous chapter, we focused on utilizing queries from the `CORE` perspective.

In this chapter, we explain the components, lifecycle, and interaction methods of the `Session` used in the ORM approach.

<br>

## Inserting rows with ORM

The `Session` object, when using ORM, creates Insert objects and emits them in transactions. `Session` adds object entries to perform these processes. Then, through a process called `flush`, it records the new items in the database.

### Instances of Objects Representing Rows

In the previous process, we executed INSERT using a Python Dictionary.

In ORM, we directly use user-defined Python objects defined in the table metadata definition.

```python
>>> squidward = User(name="squidward", fullname="Squidward Tentacles")
>>> krabs = User(name="ehkrabs", fullname="Eugene H. Krabs")
```

We create two `User` objects that represent potential database rows to be INSERTed. Because of `__init__()` constructor automatically created by ORM mapping, we can create each object using the constructor's column names as keys.

```python
>>> squidward
User(id=None, name='squidward', fullname='Squidward Tentacles')
```

Similar to Core's `Insert`, ORM integrates it even without including a primary key. The `None` value for `id` is provided by SQLAlchemy to indicate that the attribute does not have a value yet.

Currently, the two objects (`squiward` and `krabs`) are in a state called `transient`. The `transient` state means they are not yet connected to any database and not yet associated with a `Session` object that can generate an `INSERT` statement.

### Adding Objects to the `Session`

```python
>>> session = Session(engine)   # It is essential to close after use.
>>> session.add(squidward)      # Insert an object into session via Session.add() method.
>>> session.add(krabs)
```

When an object is added to the `Session` through `Session.add()`, it is called being in the `pending` state.
The pending state means the object has not yet been added to the database.

```python
>>> session.new   # You can check the objects in the pending state through session.new. Objects are added to the Session using the Session.add() method.
IdentitySet([User(id=None, name='squidward', fullname='Squidward Tentacles'), User(id=None, name='ehkrabs', fullname='Eugene H. Krabs')])
```

- `IdentitySet` is a Python set that hashes object IDs in all cases.
- That is, it uses the `id()` method, not the `hash()` function of Python's built-in functions."

### Flushing

The `Session` object uses the [unit of work pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html). This means that it accumulates changes but does not actually communicate with the database until necessary.
This behavior allows objects in the previously mentioned `pending` state to be used more efficiently in SQL DML.
The process of actually sending the current changes to the Database via SQL is called flushing.

```python
>>> session.flush()
"""
INSERT INTO user_account (name, fullname) VALUES (?, ?)
[...] ('squidward', 'Squidward Tentacles')
INSERT INTO user_account (name, fullname) VALUES (?, ?)
[...] ('ehkrabs', 'Eugene H. Krabs')
"""
```

Now, the transaction remains open until one of `Session.commit()`, `Session.rollback()`, or `Session.close()` is invoked.

While you can use `Session.flush()` directly to push the current pending contents, `Session` typically features `autoflush`, so this is usually not necessary. `Session.commit()` flushes changes every time it is called.

### Automatically Generated Primary Key Properties

When a row is inserted, the Python object we created becomes `persistent`.
The `persistent` state is associated with the loaded `Session` object.

During `INSERT`, the ORM retrieves the primary key identifier for each new object.
This uses the same `CursorResult.inserted_primary_key` accessor introduced earlier.

```python
>>> squidward.id
4
>>> krabs.id
5
```

> When ORM is flushed, instead of `executemany`, two separate INSERT statements are used because of this `CursorResult.inserted_primary_key`.
> In SQLite, for instance, you need to `INSERT` one column at a time to use the auto-increment feature (other various databases like PostgreSQL's IDENTITY or SERIAL function similarly).
> If a database connection like `psycopg2`, which can provide primary key information for many rows at once, is used, the ORM optimizes this to `INSERT` many rows at once."

### Identity Map

`Identity Map` (`ID Map`) is an in-memory storage that links all objects currently loaded in memory to their primary key IDs. You can retrieve one of these objects through `Session.get()`. This method searches for the object in the `ID Map` if it's in memory, or through a `SELECT` statement if it's not.

```python
>>> some_squidward = session.get(User, 4)
>>> some_squidward
User(id=4, name='squidward', fullname='Squidward Tentacles')
```

An important point is that the `ID Map` maintains unique objects among Python objects.

```python
>>> some_squidward is squidward 
True
```

The `ID Map` is a crucial feature that allows manipulation of complex object sets within a transaction in an unsynchronized state.

### Committing

We now `commit` the current changes to the transaction.

```python
>>> session.commit()
COMMIT
```

<br>

## How to UPDATE ORM objects

There are two ways to perform an `UPDATE` through ORM:

1. Using the `unit of work` pattern employed by `Session`. `UPDATE` operations for each primary key with changes are sent out in sequence.
2. Known as "ORM usage update", where you can explicitly use the `Update` construct with Session."

### Updating changes automatically

```python
>>> sandy = session.execute(select(User).filter_by(name="sandy")).scalar_one()
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.name = ?
[...] ('sandy',)
"""
```

This 'Sandy' user object acts as a _proxy_ for a row in the database, more specifically, for the row with primary key `2` from the transaction's perspective.

```python
>>> sandy
User(id=2, name='sandy', fullname='Sandy Cheeks')
>>> sandy.fullname = "Sandy Squirrel"   # When an object's attribute is changed, the Session records this change.
>>> sandy in session.dirty              # Such changed objects are referred to as 'dirty' and can be checked in session.dirty.
True
```

When the `Session` executes `flush`, an `UPDATE` is executed in the database, actually updating the values in the database. If a `SELECT` statement is executed afterwards, a `flush` is automatically executed, allowing you to immediately retrieve the updated name value of Sandy through `SELECT`.

```python
>>> sandy_fullname = session.execute(
...     select(User.fullname).where(User.id == 2)
... ).scalar_one()
"""
UPDATE user_account SET fullname=? WHERE user_account.id = ?
[...] ('Sandy Squirrel', 2)
SELECT user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.id = ?
[...] (2,)
"""
>>> print(sandy_fullname)
Sandy Squirrel
# Using the flush, Sandy's changes are actually reflected in the database,
# causing the object to lose its 'dirty' status.
>>> sandy in session.dirty 
False
```

### ORM usage update

The last method to perform an `UPDATE` through ORM is to explicitly use 'ORM usage update'. This allows you to use a general SQL `UPDATE` statement that can affect many rows at once.


```python
>>> session.execute(
...     update(User).
...     where(User.name == "sandy").
...     values(fullname="Sandy Squirrel Extraordinaire")
... )
"""
UPDATE user_account SET fullname=? WHERE user_account.name = ?
[...] ('Sandy Squirrel Extraordinaire', 'sandy')
"""
<sqlalchemy.engine.cursor.CursorResult object ...>
```
If there are objects in the current `Session` that match the given conditions, the corresponding `update` will also be reflected in these objects.

```python
>>> sandy.fullname
'Sandy Squirrel Extraordinaire'
```

<br>

## How to Delete ORM objects

You can mark individual ORM objects for deletion using the `Session.delete()` method. Once `delete` is executed, objects in that `Session` become expired.

```python
>>> patrick = session.get(User, 3)
"""
SELECT user_account.id AS user_account_id, user_account.name AS user_account_name,
user_account.fullname AS user_account_fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.id = ?
[...] (3,)
"""
>>> session.delete(patrick)     # Indicate that patrick will be deleted
>>> session.execute(
...     select(User)
...     .where(User.name == "patrick")
... ).first()                   # Execute flush at this point
"""
SELECT address.id AS address_id, address.email_address AS address_email_address,
address.user_id AS address_user_id
FROM address
WHERE ? = address.user_id
[...] (3,)
DELETE FROM user_account WHERE user_account.id = ?
[...] (3,)
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.name = ?
[...] ('patrick',)
"""
>>> squidward in session # Once expired in the Session, the object is removed from the session.
False
```

Like the 'Sandy' used in the above `UPDATE`, these actions are only within the ongoing transaction and can be undone at any time unless _committed_.

### ORM usage delete

Like `UPDATE`, there is also 'ORM usage delete'.

```python
# This is just an example, not a necessary operation for delete.
>>> squidward = session.get(User, 4)
"""
SELECT user_account.id AS user_account_id, user_account.name AS user_account_name,
user_account.fullname AS user_account_fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.id = ?
[...] (4,)
"""

>>> session.execute(delete(User).where(User.name == "squidward"))
"""
DELETE FROM user_account WHERE user_account.name = ?
[...] ('squidward',)
<sqlalchemy.engine.cursor.CursorResult object at 0x...>
"""
```

<br>

## Rolling Back

`Session` has a `Session.rollback()` method to roll back the current operations. This method affects Python objects like the aforementioned `sandy`.
Calling `Session.rollback()` not only rolls back the transaction but also turns all objects associated with this `Session` into `expired` status. This state change triggers a self-refresh the next time the object is accessed, a process known as _lazy loading_.

```python
>>> session.rollback()
ROLLBACK
```

Looking closely at `sandy`, which is in the `expired` state, you can see that no other information remains except for special SQLAlchemy-related status objects.

```python
>>> sandy.__dict__
{'_sa_instance_state': <sqlalchemy.orm.state.InstanceState object at 0x...>}
>>> sandy.fullname      # Since the session is expired, accessing the object properties will trigger a new transaction.
"""
SELECT user_account.id AS user_account_id, user_account.name AS user_account_name,
user_account.fullname AS user_account_fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.id = ?
[...] (2,)
"""
'Sandy Cheeks'
>>> sandy.__dict__    # Now you can see that the database row is also filled in the sandy object.
{'_sa_instance_state': <sqlalchemy.orm.state.InstanceState object at 0x...>,
 'id': 2, 'name': 'sandy', 'fullname': 'Sandy Cheeks'}
```

For the deleted objects, you can see that they are restored in the `Session` and appear again in the database.

```python
>>> patrick in session
True
>>> session.execute(select(User).where(User.name == 'patrick')).scalar_one() is patrick
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.name = ?
[...] ('patrick',)
"""
True
```

<br>

## Closing the `Session`

We have handled the `Session` outside of the context structure, and in such cases, it is good practice to _explicitly_ close the `Session` as follows:

```python
>>> session.close()
ROLLBACK
```

Similarly, when a `Session` created through a context statement is closed within the context statement, the following actions are performed.

- Cancel all ongoing transactions (e.g., rollbacks) to release all connection resources to the connection pool.
  - This means you don't need to explicitly call `Session.rollback()` to check if the transaction was rolled back when closing the `Session` after performing some read-only operations with it. The connection pool handles this.
- Remove all objects from the `Session`.
  - This means that all Python objects loaded for this Session, such as `sandy`, `patrick`, and `squidward`, are now in a `detached` state. For instance, an object that was in the `expired` state is no longer associated with a database transaction to refresh data due to a `Session.commit()` call, and it does not contain the current row's state.
  - ```python
    >>> squidward.name
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    sqlalchemy.orm.exc.DetachedInstanceError: Instance <User at 0x...> is not bound to a Session; attribute refresh operation cannot proceed
    ```
  - Detached objects can be reassociated with the same or a new `Session` using the `Session.add()` method, re-establishing the relationship with a specific database row.
  - ```python
    >>> session.add(squidward)    # Reconnect to the session
    >>> squidward.name            # Retrieve the information through the transaction again.
    """
    SELECT user_account.id AS user_account_id, user_account.name AS user_account_name, user_account.fullname AS user_account_fullname
    FROM user_account
    WHERE user_account.id = ?
    [...] (4,)
    """
    'squidward'
    ```

> Objects in the `detached` state should ideally be avoided. When a `Session` is closed, it cleans up references to all previously connected objects. Typically, the need for `detached` objects arises in web applications when an object has just been committed and the `Session` is closed before it is rendered in a view. In this case, set the `Session.expire_on_commit` flag to `False`.
