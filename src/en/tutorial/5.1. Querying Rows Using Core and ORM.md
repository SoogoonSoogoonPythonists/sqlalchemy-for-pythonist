# Querying Rows Using `Core` and `ORM`

<br>

This chapter covers the most frequently used `Select` in SQLAlchemy.

<br>

## Constructing SQL Expressions with `select()`

The `select()` constructor allows you to create query statements in the same way as the `insert()` constructor.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import select
>>> stmt = select(user_table).where(user_table.c.name == 'spongebob')
>>> print(stmt)
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.name = :name_1
"""
```

Similarly, you can put a query in the `Connection.execute()` method to execute a query statement, just like any SQL constructor at the same level (`select`, `insert`, `update`,`create` and etc.).

```python
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     for row in conn.execute(stmt):
...         print(row)
(1, 'spongebob', 'Spongebob Squarepants')
```

On the other hand, if you want to use the ORM to execute a `select` query statement, you should use `Session.exeuct()`.

The result returns a `Row` object, just like in the example just now. This object contains the `User` object that we defined in the [previous tutorial](https://soogoonsoogoonpythonists.github.io/sqlalchemy-for-pythonist/en/tutorial/4.%20Working%20with%20Database%20Metadata.html#create-a-table-object-and-add-it-to-your-metadata).

```python
>>> stmt = select(User).where(User.name == 'spongebob')
>>> with Session(engine) as session:
...     for row in session.execute(stmt):
...         # Print each row in an instance of the User object
...         print(row)
(User(id=1, name='spongebob', fullname='Spongebob Squarepants'),)
```

<br>

## Setting up the `FROM` clause and columns

The `select()` function can take a variety of objects as positional arguments, including `Column` and `Table`.

These argument values can be represented as the return value of the `select()` function, i.e., as an SQL query statement, and can also set the `FROM` clause.


```python
>>> print(select(user_table))
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
"""
```

To retrieve each column using the `Core`, you can access the `Column` object through the `Table.c` accessor.

```python
>>> print(select(user_table.c.name, user_table.c.fullname))
"""
SELECT user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
"""
```

<br>


### ORM entity and column lookups

When implementing SQL queries in SQLAlchemy, you can use ORM entities like the `User` object or attributes that map to columns, such as `User.name`, to represent tables or columns. The example below queries the `User` entity, but in fact, the result is the same as when using `user_table`.

The example below looks up the `User` entity, but the results are the same as when using `user_table`.

```python
>>> print(select(User))
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
"""
```

In the above example, the query can be executed in the same way using ORM's `Session.execute()`.

However, there is a difference between querying the `User` entity and querying `user_info`. Whether you query `user_info` or the `User` entity, in both cases a Row object is returned.

But, when querying the `User` entity, the returned `Row` object includes a `User` instance.


> Tips:
>
> The `user_table` and `User` were created in the [previous chapter](https://soogoonsoogoonpythonists.github.io/sqlalchemy-for-pythonist/en/tutorial/4.%20Working%20with%20Database%20Metadata.html),
> where `user_table` is a `Table` object, and
> `User` is an entity that inherits from the `Base` object and includes a `Table` object."

```python
>>> with Session(engine) as session:
...     row = session.execute(select(User)).first()
...     print(row)
(User(id=1, name='spongebob',fullname='Spongebob Squarepants'),)
```

Alternatively, you can query the desired columns using object attributes(class-bound attributes).

```python
>>> print(select(User.name, User.fullname))
"""
SELECT user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
"""
```

When querying object attributes using `Session.execute()`, the values of the object attributes sent as arguments (column values) are returned as follows.

```python
>>> with Session(engine) as session:
...	row = session.execute(select(User.name, User.fullname)).first()
...	print(row)
('spongebob', 'Spongebob Squarepants')
```

These methods can also be mixed and used together, as shown in the following example

```python
>>> session.execute(
...     select(User.name, Address).
...     where(User.id==Address.user_id).
...     order_by(Address.id)
... ).all()
[('spongebob', Address(id=1, email_address='spongebob@sqlalchemy.org')),
('sandy', Address(id=2, email_address='sandy@sqlalchemy.org')),
('sandy', Address(id=3, email_address='sandy@squirrelpower.org'))]
```

<br>

### Querying Labeled SQL Expressions

When you execute a query like SELECT name AS username FROM user_account, you can get the following results:

|username|
|------|
|patrick|
|sandy|
|spongebob|

Here, we've labeled the `name` column as `username`, which is why `username` appears as the column header. This functionality can be implemented in SQLAlchemy using the `ColumnElement.label()` function, as shown below:

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import func, cast
>>> stmt = (
...     select(
...         # Labeling is done like this.
...         ("Username: " + user_table.c.name).label("username"),
...     ).order_by(user_table.c.name)
... )
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     for row in conn.execute(stmt):
...         # The labeled part can be accessed like this.
...         print(f"{row.username}")
Username: patrick
Username: sandy
Username: spongebob
```
<br>

### Querying String Columns

Usually, columns are queried using the `Select` object or the `select()` constructor, but sometimes you need to query a column along with an arbitrary string. This section covers how to query such string data.

The `text()` constructor was introduced in a [previous chapter 3](https://soogoonsoogoonpythonists.github.io/sqlalchemy-for-pythonist/en/tutorial/3.%20Executing%20Transactions%20and%20Queries.html). Transactions and Database API Operations. It allows you to directly use a `SELECT` statement within it.


Let's consider a scenario where we want to execute a query like `SELECT 'some_phrase', name FROM user_account`. In this case, since some_phrase is a string, it must be enclosed in either single or double quotes. Consequently, the output will inevitably have single quotes around the string.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import text
>>> stmt = (
...     select(
...         text("'some phrase'"), user_table.c.name
...     ).order_by(user_table.c.name)
... )
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     print(conn.execute(stmt).all())
[('some phrase', 'patrick'), ('some phrase', 'sandy'), ('some phrase', 'spongebob')]
```
Therefore, instead of `text()`, it is common to use `literal_column()` to solve the problem of having single quotes attached to the output. `text()` and `literal_column()` are almost similar, but `literal_column()` explicitly signifies a column and can be labeled for use in subqueries and other SQL expressions."

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import literal_column
>>> stmt = (
...     select(
...         literal_column("'some phrase'").label("p"), user_table.c.name
...     ).order_by(user_table.c.name)
... )
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     for row in conn.execute(stmt):
...         print(f"{row.p}, {row.name}")
some phrase, patrick
some phrase, sandy
some phrase, spongebob

```

<br>

## `WHERE` Clauses

Using SQLAlchemy, you can easily write queries to output data where conditions like `name = 'thead'` or `user_id > 10 ` are met using Python operators.

```python
>>> print(user_table.c.name == 'squidward')
user_account.name = :name_1

>>> print(address_table.c.user_id > 10)
address.user_id > :user_id_1
```

To create a `WHERE` clause, you can pass arguments to the `Select.where()` method.

```python
>>> print(select(user_table).where(user_table.c.name == 'squidward'))
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.name = :name_1
"""
```


When implementing a `JOIN` with a `WHERE` clause, it can be written as follows.

```python
>>> print(
...         select(address_table.c.email_address).
...         where(user_table.c.name == 'squidward').
...         where(address_table.c.user_id == user_table.c.id)
... )
"""
SELECT address.email_address
FROM address, user_account
WHERE user_account.name = :name_1 AND address.user_id = user_account.id
"""

# The same expression can be used, but you can also pass parameters to the where() method.
>>> print(
        select(address_table.c.email_address).
...         where(
...             user_table.c.name == 'squidward',
...             address_table.c.user_id == user_table.c.id
...         )
... )
"""
SELECT address.email_address
FROM address, user_account
WHERE user_account.name = :name_1 AND address.user_id = user_account.id
"""
```

It's also possible to use conjunctions such as `and_()` and `or_()`.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import and_, or_
>>> print(
...     select(Address.email_address).
...         where(
...             and_(
...                 or_(User.name == 'squidward', User.name == 'sandy'),
...                 Address.user_id == User.id
...             )
...         )
...  )
"""
SELECT address.email_address
FROM address, user_account
WHERE (user_account.name = :name_1 OR user_account.name = :name_2)
AND address.user_id = user_account.id
"""
```

For simple equality or inequality comparisons, `Select.filter_by()` is often used.
```python
>>> print(
...     select(User).filter_by(name='spongebob', fullname='Spongebob Squarepants')
... )
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
WHERE user_account.name = :name_1 AND user_account.fullname = :fullname_1
"""
```

<br>

## Specifying the `FROM` Clause and `JOIN`s

As mentioned before, the `FROM` clause is automatically set based on the columns included as arguments in the `select()` method, without the need for explicit specification.
```python
#     Even without specifying the FROM clause explicitly, it is set and displayed in the output.
>>> print(select(user_table.c.name))
"""
SELECT user_account.name
FROM user_account
"""
```

If you want to reference columns from two different tables in the positional arguments of `select()`, you can separate them with a comma (`,`).
```python
>>> print(select(user_table.c.name, address_table.c.email_address))
"""
SELECT user_account.name, address.email_address
FROM user_account, address
"""
```

If you want to join two different tables, there are two methods you can use:

One is the `Select.join()` method, which allows you to explicitly specify the left and right tables for the `JOIN`.
```python
>>> print(
...     select(user_table.c.name, address_table.c.email_address).
...     join_from(user_table, address_table)
... )
"""
SELECT user_account.name, address.email_address
FROM user_account JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id
"""
```

The other is to explicitly specify only the right table in the `Select.join()` method, and let the other table be implicitly referenced when selecting columns.
```python
# This expression is the same, but the left table to join (user_table) is expressed implicitly.
>>> print(
...     select(user_table.c.name, address_table.c.email_address).
...     join(address_table)
... )
"""
SELECT user_account.name, address.email_address
FROM user_account JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id
"""
```

Alternatively, if you want to write the two JOINing tables more explicitly, or if you want to provide explicit additional options in the `FROM` clause, you can write it as follows.
```python
>>> print(
...     select(address_table.c.email_address).
...     select_from(user_table).join(address_table)
... )
"""
SELECT address.email_address
FROM user_account JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id
"""
```

Another case for using `Select.select_from()` is when we cannot implicitly set the `FROM` clause through the columns we want to query.

For example, to query `count(*)` in a typical SQL query, you would need to use `sqlalchemy.sql.expression.func` from SQLAlchemy.


```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import func
>>> print(select(func.count('*')).select_from(user_table))
"""
SELECT count(:count_2) AS count_1
FROM user_account
"""
```

<br>

### Setting the `ON` Clause

But there was something unusual, wasn't there?
In fact, in the previous example, when joining two tables using `Select.select_from()` or `select.join()`, the `ON` clause was implicitly set.

This automatic setting of the `ON` clause happened because the `user_table` and `address_table` objects have a ForeignKeyConstraint, i.e., a foreign key constraint, which led to the automatic setting.

If the two tables targeted for a Join lack such constraint keys, you must explicitly specify the `ON` clause. This functionality can be explicitly set by passing parameters to the `Select.join()` or `Select.join_from()` methods for the `ON` clause.

```python
>>> print(
...     select(address_table.c.email_address).
...     select_from(user_table).
...     join(address_table, user_table.c.id == address_table.c.user_id)
... )
"""
SELECT address.email_address
FROM user_account JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id
"""
```
<br>


### OUTER, FULL Join

To implement `LEFT OUTER JOIN` or `FULL OUTER JOIN` In SQLAlchemy, you can use the keyword arguments `Select.join.isouter` and `Select.join.full` in the `Select.join()` and `Select.join_from()` methods.

An examples of implementing the `LEFT OUTER JOIN`:
```python
>>> print(
...     select(user_table).join(address_table, isouter=True)
... )
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account LEFT OUTER JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id
"""
```

An examples of implementing the `FULL OUTER JOIN`:
```python
>>> print(
...     select(user_table).join(address_table, full=True)
... )
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account FULL OUTER JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id
"""
```


<br>


## ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING

- The `ORDER BY` clause allows you to set the order of the rows retrieved by the `SELECT` clause.
- The `GROUP BY` clause creates groups based on a specific column for rows aggregated by group functions.
- `HAVING` applies conditions to groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause.

<br>

### ORDER BY

You can implement the ORDER BY feature using `Select.order_by()`. This method accepts Column objects or similar objects as positional arguments. 

```python
>>> print(select(user_table).order_by(user_table.c.name))
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account ORDER BY user_account.name
"""
```
Ascending and descending order can be implemented using the `ColumnElement.asc()` and `ColumnElement.desc()` modifiers, respectively. 

The following example orders by the `user_account.fullname` column in descending order.
```python
>>> print(select(User).order_by(User.fullname.desc()))
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account ORDER BY user_account.fullname DESC
"""
```
<br>

### Aggregations: GROUP BY, HAVING

In SQL, aggregate functions can also be used to combine multiple rows into a single row. Examples of aggregate functions include `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `AVG()`.

SQLAlchemy provides SQL functions using the func namespace, where `func` creates a `Function` instance when given the name of an SQL function.

In the example below, the `count()` function is called to render the `user_account.id` column with the SQL `COUNT()` function.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import func
>>> count_fn = func.count(user_table.c.id)
>>> print(count_fn)
"""
count(user_account.id)
"""
```

More details about SQL functions are explained in [Handling SQL Functions]().

To summarize:

`GROUP BY` is a function needed to divide the retrieved rows into specific groups. In SQL, if a few columns are queried in the `SELECT` clause, these columns are directly or indirectly dependent on the primary key in the `GROUP BY`.

`HAVING` is necessary to apply conditions to groups created by `GROUP BY` (similar to the `WHERE` clause because it places conditions on groups).

In SQLAlchemy, `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` can be implemented using `Select.group_by()` and `Select.having()`.

```python
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     result = conn.execute(
...         select(User.name, func.count(Address.id).label("count")).
...         join(Address).
...         group_by(User.name).
...         having(func.count(Address.id) > 1)
...     )
...     print(result.all())
""" The syntax above represents the SQL statement below.
SELECT user_account.name, count(address.id) AS count
FROM user_account JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id GROUP BY user_account.name
HAVING count(address.id) > ?
[...] (1,)
"""

[('sandy', 2)]
```
<br>


### Grouping or ordering by alias

In some database backends, when using aggregate functions to query tables, it is important not to **restate** already specified aggregate functions in the `ORDER BY` or `GROUP BY` clauses.

```sql
# NOT GOOD
SELECT id, COUNT(id) FROM user_account GROUP BY id ORDER BY count(id)

# CORRECT
SELECT id, COUNT(id) as cnt_id FROM user_account GROUP BY id ORDER BY cnt_id
```

Therefore, to implement `ORDER BY` or `GROUP BY` using aliases, you just need to insert the alias you want to use as an argument in the `Select.order_by()` or `Select.group_by()` methods.

The alias used here is not rendered first; instead, the alias used in the column clause is rendered first. If the rendered alias does not match anything in the rest of the query, an error occurs.


```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import func, desc
>>> # The alias 'num_addresses' is used in both the column and in the order_by clause.
>>> stmt = select(
...         Address.user_id,
...         func.count(Address.id).label('num_addresses')).\
...         group_by("user_id").order_by("user_id", desc("num_addresses"))
>>> print(stmt)
"""
SELECT address.user_id, count(address.id) AS num_addresses
FROM address GROUP BY address.user_id ORDER BY address.user_id, num_addresses DESC
"""
```
<br>


## Using aliases

When using `JOIN` to query multiple tables, it's often necessary to repeatedly write the table names in the query.

In SQL, this issue can be addressed by giving _aliases_ to table names or subqueries, reducing repetition.

In SQLAlchemy, such aliases can be implemented using the Core's `FromClause.alias()` function.

Within the `Table` object namespace, there are `Column` objects, allowing access to column names via `Table.c`.

```python
print(select(user_table.c.name, user_table.c.fullname))
"""
SELECT user_account.name, user_account.fullname
FROM user_account
"""
``` 

Similarly, in the `Alias` object namespace, there are `Column` objects, making it possible to access columns via `Alias.c`.

```python
>>> # Both user_alias_1 and user_alias_2 are Alias objects.
>>> user_alias_1 = user_table.alias(‘table1’) 
>>> user_alias_2 = user_table.alias(‘table2’)
>>> # To access columns using the newly created table aliases,
>>> # you should use Alias.c.column_name
>>> print(
...     select(user_alias_1.c.name, user_alias_2.c.name).
...     join_from(user_alias_1, user_alias_2, user_alias_1.c.id > user_alias_2.c.id)
... )

"""
SELECT table1.name, table2.name AS name_1 
FROM user_account AS table1 JOIN user_account AS table2 ON table1.id > table2.id
"""
```

<br>

### ORM Entity Aliases

The ORM in SQLAlchemy also has a function similar to the `FromClause.alias()` method, known as `aliased()` 

This ORM `aliased()` function internally creates an `Alias` object for the originally mapped `Table` object, while maintaining ORM functionalities.

> Tips:
>
> The `user_table` and `User` were created in the [previous chapter](https://soogoonsoogoonpythonists.github.io/sqlalchemy-for-pythonist/en/tutorial/4.%20Working%20with%20Database%20Metadata.html),
> where `user_table` is a `Table` object, and
> `User` is an entity that inherits from the `Base` object and includes a `Table` object."


```python
>>> user_alias_1 = user_table.alias()
>>> user_alias_2 = user_table.alias()
>>> # In the examples, it is applied to the User or Address entities.
>>> print(
...     select(User).
...     join_from(User, address_alias_1).
...     where(address_alias_1.email_address == 'patrick@aol.com').
...     join_from(User, address_alias_2).
...     where(address_alias_2.email_address == 'patrick@gmail.com')
... )
"""
SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname 
FROM user_account JOIN address AS address_1 ON user_account.id = address_1.user_id JOIN address AS address_2 ON user
"""
```

<br>

## Subqueries and CTE(Common Table Expression)s

This section explains subqueries typically found in the `FROM` clause of a `SELECT` statement. It also covers CTEs (Common Table Expressions), which are used in a similar way to subqueries but with additional functionalities.

> More about CTE
>
> A CTE is a temporary result set within a query that can be referenced multiple times within the same query.
> You can check the official links to describe CTEs in RDBMS below.
>
> - [PostgreSQL: WITH Queries (Common Table Expressions)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-with.html)
> - [MySQL: WITH (Common Table Expressions)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html)
> - [MariaDB: WITH](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/with/)


SQLAlchemy represents subqueries using the `Subquery` object created by `Select.subquery()`, and CTEs are represented using `Select.cte()`.

```python
>>> subq = select(
...     func.count(address_table.c.id).label("count"),
...     address_table.c.user_id
... ).group_by(address_table.c.user_id).subquery()
>>> print(subq)
"""
SELECT count(address.id) AS count, address.user_id
FROM address GROUP BY address.user_id
"""

>>> # The ON clause automatically binds two tables
>>> # that are already constrained by a foreign key.
>>> stmt = select(
...    user_table.c.name,
...    user_table.c.fullname,
...    subq.c.count
... ).join_from(user_table, subq)
>>> print(stmt)
"""
SELECT user_account.name, user_account.fullname, anon_1.count
FROM user_account JOIN (SELECT count(address.id) AS count, address.user_id AS user_id
FROM address GROUP BY address.user_id) AS anon_1 ON user_account.id = anon_1.user_id
"""
```
<br>

### Hierarchy Query

The method of using CTE syntax in SQLAlchemy is almost identical to how subquery syntax is used. Instead of calling the `Select.subquery()` method, you use `Select.cte()`, allowing the resulting object to be used as a FROM element.

```python
>>> subq = select(
...     func.count(address_table.c.id).label("count"),
...     address_table.c.user_id
... ).group_by(address_table.c.user_id).cte()

>>> stmt = select(
...    user_table.c.name,
...    user_table.c.fullname,
...    subq.c.count
... ).join_from(user_table, subq)

>>> print(stmt)
"""
WITH anon_1 AS
(SELECT count(address.id) AS count, address.user_id AS user_id
FROM address GROUP BY address.user_id)
 SELECT user_account.name, user_account.fullname, anon_1.count
FROM user_account JOIN anon_1 ON user_account.id = anon_1.user_id
"""
```

<br>


### ORM Entity Subqueries, CTE

You can see that `aliased()` performs the same operation for `Subquery` and `CTE` subqueries.

```python
>>> subq = select(Address).where(~Address.email_address.like('%@aol.com')).subquery()
>>> address_subq = aliased(Address, subq)
>>> stmt = select(User, address_subq).join_from(User, address_subq).order_by(User.id, address_subq.id)
>>> with Session(engine) as session:
...     for user, address in session.execute(stmt):
...         print(f"{user} {address}")

""" The above syntax represents the following query:

SELECT user_account.id, user_account.name, user_account.fullname,
anon_1.id AS id_1, anon_1.email_address, anon_1.user_id
FROM user_account JOIN
(SELECT address.id AS id, address.email_address AS email_address, address.user_id AS user_id
FROM address
WHERE address.email_address NOT LIKE ?) AS anon_1 ON user_account.id = anon_1.user_id
ORDER BY user_account.id, anon_1.id
[...] ('%@aol.com',)
"""

User(id=1, name='spongebob', fullname='Spongebob Squarepants') Address(id=1, email_address='spongebob@sqlalchemy.org')
User(id=2, name='sandy', fullname='Sandy Cheeks') Address(id=2, email_address='sandy@sqlalchemy.org')
User(id=2, name='sandy', fullname='Sandy Cheeks') Address(id=3, email_address='sandy@squirrelpower.org')
```

Below is an example of querying the same result using the CTE constructor:

```python
>>> cte = select(Address).where(~Address.email_address.like('%@aol.com')).cte()
>>> address_cte = aliased(Address, cte)
>>> stmt = select(User, address_cte).join_from(User, address_cte).order_by(User.id, address_cte.id)
>>> with Session(engine) as session:
...     for user, address in session.execute(stmt):
...         print(f"{user} {address}")

## Scalar Subqueries and Correlated Queries

Before explaining scalar subqueries, let's briefly discuss subqueries in SQL. [출처:바이헨 블로그](https://rinuas.tistory.com/entry/%EC%84%9C%EB%B8%8C%EC%BF%BC%EB%A6%ACSub-Query)

A "_subquery_" is a `SELECT` statement within another SQL statement, and the outer SQL statement is referred to as the "_main query_".

The types of subqueries are determined based on whether they reference columns of the main query, where they are declared, and the number of rows they return.

- Classification based on reference to main query columns:
    - **Correlated Subqueries**: The subquery references columns of the main query.
    - **Non-correlated Subqueries**: The subquery does not reference the main query's columns and operates independently, used to convey information to the main query.
- Classification based on declaration position:
    - **Scalar Subqueries**: Subqueries that appear in the column position of a SELECT statement (correlated).
    - **Inline Views**: Subqueries in the FROM clause (correlated).
    - **Nested Subqueries**: Subqueries in the WHERE clause (non-correlated).
- Classification based on the number of rows returned:
    - **Single-row Subqueries** (return one row)
    - **Multi-row Subqueries** (return more than one row): Used with IN, ANY, ALL, EXISTS.

In SQLAlchemy, scalar subqueries use `ScalarSelect`, which is part of the `ColumnElement` object, while general subqueries use `Subquery`, which is in the `FromClause` object.

Scalar subqueries are often used as described earlier in [Aggregations](#aggregations-group-by-having).

```python
# Implementing Scalar subquery using Select.scalar_subquery()
>>> subq = select(func.count(address_table.c.id)).
...             where(user_table.c.id == address_table.c.user_id).
...             scalar_subquery()
>>> print(subq) # ... is equal to "ScalarSelect" type
"""
(SELECT count(address.id) AS count_1
FROM address, user_account
WHERE user_account.id = address.user_id)
"""
```
Scalar subqueries implemented using `Select.scalar_subquery()` render the `user_account` and `address` in the FROM clause, but since the `user_account` table is already present in the main query, it is not rendered again in the scalar subquery.

```python
>>> stmt = select(user_table.c.name, subq.label("address_count"))
>>> print(stmt)
"""
SELECT user_account.name, (SELECT count(address.id) AS count_1
FROM address
WHERE user_account.id = address.user_id) AS address_count
FROM user_account
"""
```
Meanwhile, when writing correlated queries, the connections between tables can become ambiguous.

## UNION, UNION ALL operators

In SQL, terms like `UNION` and `UNION ALL` are used to combine two `SELECT` statements.
Queries can be executed as shown below.
```sql
SELECT id FROM user_account
union 
SELECT email_address FROM address
```

Additionally, SQL supports set operations like `INTERSECT` (intersection) and `EXCEPT` (difference).
In SQLAlchemy, for Select objects, functions such as `union()`, `intersect()`, `except_()`, `union_all()`, `intersect_all()`, and `except_all()` are available.

The return value of these functions is a `CompoundSelect`, which is an object that can be used similarly to `Select` but has fewer methods.
The `CompoundSelect` object returned by `union_all()` can be executed with `Connection.execute()`.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import union_all
>>> stmt1 = select(user_table).where(user_table.c.name == 'sandy')
>>> stmt2 = select(user_table).where(user_table.c.name == 'spongebob')
>>> u = union_all(stmt1, stmt2) # A value u is a CompoundSelect type.
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     result = conn.execute(u)
...     print(result.all())

[(2, 'sandy', 'Sandy Cheeks'), (1, 'spongebob', 'Spongebob Squarepants')]
```

Just as `Select` provides the `SelectBase.subquery()` method to create `Subquery` objects, `CompoundSelect` objects can similarly be used as subqueries.

```python
>>> u_subq = u.subquery()
>>> stmt = (
...     select(u_subq.c.name, address_table.c.email_address).
...     join_from(address_table, u_subq).
...     order_by(u_subq.c.name, address_table.c.email_address)
... )
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     result = conn.execute(stmt)
...     print(result.all())

[('sandy', 'sandy@sqlalchemy.org'), ('sandy','sandy@squirrelpower.org'), 
('spongebob', 'spongebob@sqlalchemy.org')]
```

<br>

## EXISTS Subqueries

SQLAlchemy creates an `Exists` object through the `SelectBase.exists()` method to implement the `EXISTS` clause.

```python
>>> # subq is a Exists type
>>> subq = (
...     select(func.count(address_table.c.id)).
...     where(user_table.c.id == address_table.c.user_id).
...     group_by(address_table.c.user_id).
...     having(func.count(address_table.c.id) > 1)
... ).exists()
>>> print(subq)
"""
EXISTS (SELECT count(address.id) AS count_1 
FROM address, user_account 
WHERE user_account.id = address.user_id GROUP BY address.user_id 
HAVING count(address.id) > :count_2)
"""
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     result = conn.execute(
...         select(user_table.c.name).where(subq)
...     )
...     print(result.all())

[('sandy',)]
```

The `EXISTS` clause is more often used in a non-negated form by the way.

```python
# This is a query to select usernames that do not have an email address.
# Take a look at the part where the '~' operator is used."
>>> subq = (
...     select(address_table.c.id).
...     where(user_table.c.id == address_table.c.user_id)
... ).exists()
>>> stmt = select(user_table.c.name).where(~subq)
>>> print(stmt)
"""
SELECT user_account.id 
FROM user_account 
WHERE NOT (EXISTS (SELECT count(address.id) AS count_1 
FROM address 
WHERE user_account.id = address.user_id GROUP BY address.user_id 
HAVING count(address.id) > :count_2))
"""
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:
...     result = conn.execute(stmt)
...     print(result.all())

## Dealing with SQL functions.

In the earlier section [Aggregations: GROUP BY, HAVING](#aggregations-group-by-having), the `func` object, which acts as a factory for creating new `Function` objects, was introduced. When using syntax like `select()`, you can pass SQL functions created by the `func` object as arguments.

- `count()` : Aggregate functions are used to print the number of rows.
  ```python
  >>> # cnt is a type of  <class 'sqlalchemy.sql.functions.count'>.
  >>> cnt = func.count() 
  >>> print(select(cnt).select_from(user_table))
  """
  SELECT count(*) AS count_1FROM user_account
  """
  ```
- `lower()` : String functions are used to convert strings to lowercase.
  ```python
  >>> print(select(func.lower("A String With Much UPPERCASE")))
  """
  SELECT lower(:lower_2) AS lower_1
  """
  ```
- `now()` : There is also a function that returns the current time and date. This function is commonly used, so SQLAlchemy helps in easily rendering it across different backends.
  ```` python
  >>> stmt = select(func.now())
  >>> with engine.connect() as conn:
  ...     result = conn.execute(stmt)
  ...     print(result.all())

  [(datetime.datetime(...),)]
  ````

Different database backends have SQL functions with different names. Therefore, `func` allows access to any name in its namespace, automatically interpreting that name as an SQL function and rendering it.

```python
>>> # A data type of crazy_function is Function.
>>> crazy_function = func.some_crazy_function(user_table.c.fullname, 17)
>>> print(select(crazy_function))
"""
SELECT some_crazy_function(user_account.name, :some_crazy_function_2) AS some_crazy_function_1
FROM user_account
"""
```

Meanwhile, SQLAlchemy provides appropriate data types for commonly used SQL functions like `count`, `now`, `max`, `concat`, etc., specific to each backend.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy.dialects import postgresql
>>> print(select(func.now()).compile(dialect=postgresql.dialect()))
"""
SELECT now() AS now_1
"""

>>> from sqlalchemy.dialects import oracle
>>> print(select(func.now()).compile(dialect=oracle.dialect()))
"""
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS now_1 FROM DUAL
"""
 ```

### WINDOW Functions

Window functions are similar to `GROUP BY`, created to easily define relationships between rows.

In SQLAlchemy, among all SQL functions created by the `func` namespace, there is the `FunctionElement.over()` method, which implements the `OVER` clause.

One of the window functions is `row_number()`, which counts the number of rows. You can group each row by username and then number the email addresses within each group.

```python
# The FunctionElement.over.partition_by parameter is used
# to render the PARTITION BY clause in the OVER clause.
>>> stmt = select(
...     func.row_number().over(partition_by=user_table.c.name),
...     user_table.c.name,
...     address_table.c.email_address
... ).select_from(user_table).join(address_table)
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:  
...     result = conn.execute(stmt)
...     print(result.all())
[(1, 'sandy', 'sandy@sqlalchemy.org'), 
 (2, 'sandy', 'sandy@squirrelpower.org'), 
 (1, 'spongebob', 'spongebob@sqlalchemy.org')]
```

`FunctionElement.over.order_by` can be used to apply an `ORDER BY` clause.

```python
>>> stmt = select(
...     func.count().over(order_by=user_table.c.name),
...     user_table.c.name,
...     address_table.c.email_address).select_from(user_table).join(address_table)
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:  
...     result = conn.execute(stmt)
...     print(result.all())

[(2, 'sandy', 'sandy@sqlalchemy.org'), 
 (2, 'sandy', 'sandy@squirrelpower.org'), 
 (3, 'spongebob', 'spongebob@sqlalchemy.org')]
```
<br> 

### Special Modifiers like WITHIN GROUP, FILTER

The SQL clause `WITHIN GROUP` is used with ordered sets or hypothetical sets along with aggregate functions.

Common ordered set functions include `percentile_cont()` and `rank()`.

In SQLAlchemy, functions such as `rank`, `dense_rank`, `percentile_count`, and `percentile_disc` are implemented, each with the `FunctionElement`.`within_group()` method.

```python
>>> print(
...     func.unnest(
...         func.percentile_disc([0.25,0.5,0.75,1]).within_group(user_table.c.name)
...     )
... )
"""
unnest(percentile_disc(:percentile_disc_1) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY user_account.name))
"""
```

Some backends support the "FILTER" modifier, which can be utilized through the `FunctionElement.filter()` method in SQLAlchemy.

```python
>>> stmt = select(
...     func.count(address_table.c.email_address).filter(user_table.c.name == 'sandy'),
...     func.count(address_table.c.email_address).filter(user_table.c.name == 'spongebob')
... ).select_from(user_table).join(address_table)
>>> with engine.connect() as conn:  
...     result = conn.execute(stmt)
...     print(result.all())

"""
SELECT count(address.email_address) FILTER (WHERE user_account.name = ?) AS anon_1,
count(address.email_address) FILTER (WHERE user_account.name = ?) AS anon_2
FROM user_account JOIN address ON user_account.id = address.user_id
"""

('sandy', 'spongebob')
[(2, 1)]
```

### Table-Valued Functions

<br>

### Column Value Functions or Scalar Column (Table Valued Functions)

One of the special syntaxes supported by Oracle and PostgreSQL is functions set in the FROM clause. Examples in PostgreSQL include `json_array_elements()`, `json_object_keys()`, `json_each_text()`, and `json_each()`.

SQLAlchemy refers to these functions as column values and applies them using the `FunctionElement.column_valued()` specifier on a `Function` object.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import select, func
>>> stmt = select(func.json_array_elements('["one", "two"]').column_valued("x"))
>>> print(stmt)
"""
SELECT x
FROM json_array_elements(:json_array_elements_1) AS x
"""
```

Column value functions can also be used in Oracle as custom SQL functions, as shown below.

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy.dialects import oracle
>>> stmt = select(func.scalar_strings(5).column_valued("s"))
>>> print(stmt.compile(dialect=oracle.dialect()))
"""
SELECT COLUMN_VALUE s
FROM TABLE (scalar_strings(:scalar_strings_1)) s
"""
```
