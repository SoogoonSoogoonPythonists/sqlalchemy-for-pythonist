# Setting up a Connection

## Connecting to a Database

Let's try connecting to SQLite, a relatively lightweight database.  
You can do it as follows:

```python
>>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
>>> engine = create_engine("sqlite+pysqlite:///:memory:", echo=True, future=True)
```

- Use the `sqlalchemy.create_engine` function to create an **'engine'** that establishes a connection to the database.
- The first argument is a **`string URL`**.
    - Typically, the `string URL` is structured as `dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`.
        - If you don't specify a `driver`, SQLAlchemy's default settings will be used.
    - Here, `sqlite+pysqlite:///test.db` is the `string URL`.
        - For `sqlite`, the format follows `sqlite://<nohostname>/<path>`.
- From the string URL `sqlite:///test.db`, we can understand the following information:
    - **Which database** to use (`dialect`, in this case, `sqlite`)
    - **Which database API** (the driver interacting with the database) to use (in this case, `pysqlite`)
    - **How to find** the database (in this case, it uses the in-memory feature provided by `sqlite`)
- Setting the `echo` parameter to `True` prints all executed SQL.

Creating an engine doesn't yet attempt an actual connection. The real connection occurs only when a request to perform an operation on the database is received for the first time.
